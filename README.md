I was bored one day and saw [this XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1643/). I thought, why not make it a reality?

I initially prototyped this in [Cycript](http://www.cycript.org/), and then rewrote it properly in Obj-C,
which maybe explains the poor quality of code. It works well enough that I don't feel like fixing it though!
